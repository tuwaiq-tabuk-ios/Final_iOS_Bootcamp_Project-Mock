**_Humanitarian app_** that aids financially vulnerable families with donors

## Motivation
"In our society unfortunately there are people with primary necessities not covered. These people need help from the ones who have covered this basic needs.

We many times throw to the bin things like clothes or electrical devices that we don't need any more, but it would be nice if we could give these leftovers to people who will take them gratefully.

It would be great if there was a way of exchanging this goods."


## Project description
"Donation is a humanitarian app that aims to support the needy in society in the simplest and easiest way. It put in contact people with limited financial income with donators.

Donators introduce in the app the goods that would like to donate, and people in needs who are near the donator can check the app to see if there is anything they can take.

The app has a private chat used to agree on the place to do the donation, or even to have a casual conversation between the two parties. 

The goods in the app are divided in several sections such as: Furniture, clothes, University books, Ramadan baskets, Zakat al-Fitr, electrical appliances and winter Supplies."
